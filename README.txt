Tic Tac Toe Solver

Verson 0.0.1

This program is a test of simple decision making skills.  No winning conditions are hardcoded into the game.  Only whether it has won or lost.

Commands:
human - Have the computer play against you.
comp - Have the computer play one game against itself.
comp # - Have the computer play # games against itself.

When playing against the computer, you type the square value to enter your O.

The square values are:
[1,2,3]
[4,4,6]
[7,8,9]

Currently in human games, the computer will always play X.  That will be changed in the future.
